Dragon
	Foolish knights! You can never defeat me!

Knight 1
	Famous last words, [insert Dragon name]. We, the dragon hunters, will prevail. Quick, [insert Knight 2 name]! Cast
		the spell of damnation onto this beast!

	*Knight 2 starts casting spell*

Dragon
	Heh. Your unwwise decision is now about to bring you into the destruction that you have wished upon me.
	MINIONS!

	*Minions start to appear at the sides of the screen*
	
Dragon 
	Today is your lucky day! Attack these puny knights, and feast upon their flesh! <During this dialogue, minions
	will inch to the middle of the screen, surrounding the nights(probably 3-4 seconds of "walking")>

Knight 1
	Curses! [insert Knight 2 name], is the spell nearly completed?

Knight 2
	No, not yet!
	
	<Minions start to attack Knight 2>

Knight 2
	Come, help me fend off these beasts!

Minions
	Ingredients, ingredients! Delectable ingredients!

Knight 2
	Dear heavens, no...

Dragon
	DRAGON HUNTER MEAT!

Knight 1
	God, save us...

Dragon
	Minions! Take them to the dungeons, while I prepare the other ingredients!

Minions

*Minions throw the two knights in a jail cell*

*Knight 1 bursts out crying*

Knight 1
	I don't want to be ramen!!

Knight 2
	And I, as well.
